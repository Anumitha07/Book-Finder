I had used the google API which may contains 40millions of books in which some of them have preview of the book.
Using the input obtained, JavaScript constructs a request URL for the Google Books API search endpoint.
This URL typically includes the user's search query as a parameter.
An AJAX request is then sent to the Google Books API endpoint using the constructed URL.
